#If I want to build a token for a client, I would ask below questions from him. I listed the question and answers below.
1.	What is your project? Why do you need a token for it?
I have a music website which artists can upload their music and users can listen to them depends on the amount of token they porches. So, I need a token so that users can buy and spend on music.
2.	Does it need a unique token? Sth that users cannot be exchanged like other cryptographic assets or both forms? I mean can have a token that can be changed between these types.
I think I need sth exchangeable.
3.	What name do you recommend for it? Can you offer a symbol for it?
Yeah, Music Token and MTT would be a good choice.
4.	Do you want your token to have an initial amount of tokens for the deployer?
Yeah, 1000. I want to allocate some tokens to new account so that they can test the music.
5.	Do you want to be able to transfer tokens between account?
Yes please.
6.	So, I think you wouldn’t want your token to be minable. It would just be created on smart contract.
Yes, that’s fine.
7.	Do you need to remove some tokens for times you needed?
Yes, sometimes users remove their accounts.
8.	Do you need a feature so that you can stop you token from being transferred?
Yes, this seems interesting. Sometimes we need to punish some users who violate our rules.
9.	Do you want your users be able to allow third parties to transfer from their account Without paying gas?
No, only users themselves must be able to.
10.	Want your token to support voting?
No.
